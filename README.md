# pyrefactor

Pyrefactor is a swiss army knife for manipulating Python expressions, especially useful to delegate tasks from other editors.

# Usage

```
pyrefactor <action> [args...]
```

Will read expression from stdin, process it according to `action` and spit it out back to stdout...

For a list of available actions, see `pyrefactor -h`.
